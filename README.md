# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
### Overview
####
A foundation, Alphabet Soup, that helps fund nonprofits and charities through large donations has noticed an uptick in certain groups taking the funding and not succeeding in the initial goals described to the foundation. The foundation has requested that an analysis be performed using neural networks to predict if a charity will succeed with funding. Using a CSV file that contains data on previous charities that were given donations from the foundation, Python, and Colab, an analysis was performed to see if a reliable prediction of success could be made.
